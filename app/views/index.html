	<p>
		This site contains a couple of pattern generators for <a
			ng-href="#/sphere">balls</a> and
		<a ng-href="#/torus">donuts</a> in single-crochet. The generators
		should be particularly useful
		for designing amigurumi.
	</p>

	<p>
		I plan to add more generators in the future &ndash; I'm currently
		thinking about cones and cubes. If you have any suggestions for 3D
		primitives
		please let me know.
	</p>

	<h2>Note</h2>

	<p>
		The patterns assume that your stitch height is the same as
		your stitch width. This is not quite the case with single-crochet
		stitches, although the end-results seem to be okay. I am going to fix
		this at some point in the future!
	</p>

	<p>
		All patterns are generated using US crochet stitch terms.
